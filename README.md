# Programming Language Research Notes

This repository serves as a central hub for storing my notes and findings as I explore and research various programming languages. As a passionate software engineer, I believe in continuously expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest programming paradigms and technologies.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a well-organized collection of notes, code snippets, and insights gained during my research of different programming languages. By keeping track of my learning journey, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of each language's syntax, features, and best practices
- Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of different languages
- Provide a quick reference for future projects and discussions
- Share my findings with the developer community and encourage knowledge sharing

## Languages Covered

Currently, my research focuses on the following programming languages:
